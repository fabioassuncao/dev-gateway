/**
 * What this instance can actually do.
 *
 * Portta used to answer one question — "what is the domain of this project?" —
 * and derive every URL from it. That works on a laptop and fails everywhere
 * else, because a machine does not have *a* way to be reached; it has several,
 * or none, and which ones exist is a property of the host, not of the project.
 *
 * A capability is that property, detected rather than configured. It says only
 * that something **can** be used. It never means anything is exposed: choosing
 * to publish a service is a separate, deliberate act, one service at a time.
 * See docs/adr/0024-capabilities-providers-endpoints.md.
 *
 * Detection itself lives on the outside — `packages/cli/src/detect.ts` — and
 * hands this module plain facts, so the same evidence yields the same verdict
 * wherever it is read. Keeping the probes out there is what lets these
 * verdicts be tested without a host, and what keeps this package free of
 * process execution.
