# 0005 — Hostnames are derived from the labels Compose already injects

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Every service reachable through the gateway needs a unique hostname. Making
each project spell out a full `Host(...)` rule would mean every worktree has to
edit that rule — exactly the manual step that makes parallel environments
annoying enough that people stop creating them.

Docker Compose already labels every container it creates with
`com.docker.compose.project` and `com.docker.compose.service`. Together those
are unique on a host and are precisely the two things a hostname should carry.

## Decision

The convention is:

```
<compose-project>-<service>.<domain>
```

It is implemented once, in Traefik's `providers.docker.defaultRule`, as a Go
template over those labels:

```
Host(`{{ normalize (index .Labels "com.docker.compose.project") }}-{{ normalize (index .Labels "com.docker.compose.service") }}.<domain>`)
```

`normalize` makes the result DNS-safe. Containers with no Compose labels fall
back to the normalised container name. A project that wants a different
hostname sets an explicit `traefik.http.routers.<name>.rule` label, which wins.

One level of subdomain is used rather than `service.project.domain`, so a
single wildcard certificate (`*.dev.example.com`) covers everything.

## Consequences

A project opts in without naming itself anywhere, and a new worktree gets new
hostnames purely by changing `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`.

The trade-off is that hostnames get long — `base-empresarial-issue59-api` — and
that two project names differing only in punctuation normalise to the same
label. `doctor` reports that collision rather than letting one project quietly
receive the other's traffic.
