# 0030. The panel may operate a project, without owning it

**Status:** Accepted, amends [0001](0001-decoupled-infrastructure.md)

## Context

[ADR 0001](0001-decoupled-infrastructure.md) forbids the gateway from taking
part in a consumer project's lifecycle. That sentence is still the right
*ownership* claim: Portta does not move projects, mount their directories into
the gateway, own their volumes, or run `docker system prune`.

The *practice* has already moved. The panel starts, stops, restarts and removes
one container at a time ([ADR 0008](0008-web-panel-socket-proxy.md)), with
`assertNotGatewayOwned` refusing Portta's own components and `removeContainer`
hard-coding `v=0`. Four features that follow from a remote development host —
turning a whole project off, rebuilding it, removing it from this host, starting
a per-workspace editor — cannot be built against the letter of ADR 0001, and
cannot be built by widening the socket proxy either. [ADR 0026](0026-applying-settings-from-the-panel.md)
already rejected that: resolving overlays against `.env` is reimplementing
Compose inside the panel.

This record redraws the line the code already makes, and names one mechanism
for the operations Compose itself must perform.

## Decision

**Portta does not own a project. It may operate one, on request.**

| | Portta may | Portta may not |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime state** | start, stop, restart containers it can see | — |
| **Composition** | rebuild and recreate on the operator's explicit request | change a project's Compose files |
| **Data** | — | remove a volume unless the operator names the project to confirm |
| **Anything remote** | — | ever, under any operation |

The load-bearing sentence kept from ADR 0001 is the ownership one. Acquiring
the ability to operate containers on request is a different claim, and the one
the panel already makes per container.

### One runner, still opt-in, still a fixed command

`portta up` prepares a second container, stopped, when `PORTTA_RUNNER=true`.
It follows ADR 0026 exactly:

- runs on the host, with the Docker socket, the Portta root, and the host
  filesystem mounted at `/host`, labelled `portta.managed=true` and
  `portta.component=runner`;
- accepts a **verb from a closed set**, never a command line — `up`, `stop`,
  `restart`, `build`, `down`, `down-volumes` — plus a project name;
- is gated behind `PORTTA_RUNNER`, which is absent from the panel's field
  catalogue, the way `PORTTA_APPLY` is;
- reports outcome by having the panel read the container back (state, exit
  code, log tail since `StartedAt`).

The panel's Docker permission stays `POST /containers/{id}/start` and read.
`docker/compose/features/web.yaml` and the in-process allowlist are not
widened. Adding a verb to the set is an ADR-level change, not a patch.

The request the runner reads is `{ verb, project, flags? }` in
`state/runner/request.json`. Flags are a closed set too: `no-cache` is valid
only with `build`; `directory` is valid only with `down-volumes`. Adding a
flag is the same class of change as adding a verb. The working directory and
Compose files come from Docker's own labels
(`com.docker.compose.project.working_dir`, `.config_files`), never from a
path the panel supplied. The runner translates those host paths through
`/host` so it can read the files; `--project-directory` stays the host path,
because Compose hands bind mounts to the daemon.

Directory removal is the runner's job, not the panel's. The path is the
label, validated as an existing directory that is not `/`, not a top-level
directory, and does not walk up. A dirty working tree is refused unless the
operator overrides after seeing the counts.

### Where a project lives

Labels are the primary source: they are the project's own truth and need no
registration. A project whose working-directory label is missing is **not
operable**, shown with a reason. Workspace records do not override the path in
this decision; an override would be a path the operator typed, and that is a
later change.

### The safety envelope

- A verb that destroys data (`down-volumes`, directory removal) requires the
  **project name typed back**, checked on the server.
- Portta's own components are refused by name, reusing `assertNotGatewayOwned`.
- No operation ever touches a Git remote, a GitHub repository, an issue or a
  branch.
- Every operation is logged where the operator can read it back.
- The working directory is validated as an existing directory and never
  concatenated into a shell string.

What ADR 0001 still forbids, unchanged: moving or cloning projects, mounting
project directories into the **gateway**, owning volumes, and any `docker *
prune`.

## Consequences

Four features share one mechanism and one place to audit. A host that never
sets `PORTTA_RUNNER` has zero new attack surface; the panel renders that
absence with a reason, as `whyUnavailable` already does for the applier.

The runner is the largest privilege in the system: a root container with the
Docker socket and a view of the host filesystem. The closed verb set, the
opt-in key, and the project name validated against the live snapshot are what
keep it bounded. A project started outside Compose has no working-directory
label and is reported as not operable rather than offered a dead button.

## Amended 2026-09-03: a remembered environment, and `include:`

An Environment whose containers are all gone used to leave the panel: the
snapshot only knows what Docker still holds, so the row the database kept
(ADR 0013) had nothing to attach to, and `up` was a verb the panel never
dispatched. Two changes close that gap without widening the runner.

**`up` carries the paths when no container exists.** The snapshot records
`config_files` beside `working_dir` in `environments`, and a remembered
Environment is a full `Environment` with no services and
`presence: remembered`. Start on one hands the runner
`{ verb: "up", project, workingDir, configFiles }`. The panel validates both
paths against the bound `remove_working_dir` already applies (absolute, no
`..`, not `/`, not a top-level directory) and refuses a comma, a quote or a
backslash, which is what lets the shell read the list as text. The runner
uses those fields **only** when `docker ps` finds no container for the
project; with one, labels win exactly as before, and any verb but `up` with
no container still dies. Portta's own project is refused by name, from
`PORTTA_PROJECT_NAME` in `.env`, and by directory, `PORTTA_ROOT`. Without
the runner, the answer is a 409 whose hint is the exact `docker compose …
up -d` to run on the host. Forgetting a remembered Environment drops its row;
a live one is refused.

**Host paths are linked under the runner so `include:` resolves.** The
runner used to pass `-f /host<file>`, so a Compose file that named a path
(`include:`, `extends`, an `env_file`, a relative bind) resolved it against
the container's own root, where it did not exist. The runner now links the
first missing ancestor of the working directory, and of every Compose file
outside it, to its `/host` counterpart, and hands Compose the host paths with
`--project-directory` unchanged. An ancestor that exists in the image and is
not that link is an error, stated, never a silent misread. The repository
root is already mounted at its own path and needs no link.
