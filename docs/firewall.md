# Firewall

The gateway **never changes a firewall rule**. It tells you what is listening
and what a rule set should look like; applying it stays your decision.

```bash
portta network status
```

shows interfaces, the tailnet address, every published port split by whether
the gateway or a consumer project owns it, and the host listeners on the
gateway's ports.

## Ubuntu with UFW

### Private profile (recommended)

Nothing needs to be open. Traefik listens on the tailnet interface only, and
Tailscale itself needs no inbound rule, because it establishes outbound
connections and negotiates a path.

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH          # keep this, or lock yourself out
sudo ufw enable
```

Optionally allow the Tailscale interface explicitly:

```bash
sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0
```

### Public profile

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

Those two, and nothing more. Never open 5432, 3306, 6379, 27017 or 2375/2376.

## Docker and UFW

Worth knowing: **Docker's published ports bypass UFW.** Docker writes its own
`iptables` rules in the `DOCKER-USER` chain, ahead of the ones UFW manages. A
`ports:` entry bound to `0.0.0.0` is reachable even with UFW denying
everything.

This is exactly why the gateway treats the bind address as the security
boundary rather than the firewall:

- the local profile binds `127.0.0.1`;
- the private profile refuses `0.0.0.0` and, with Tailscale, publishes nothing
  at all;
- databases and caches are never published, in any profile.

To filter Docker-published ports, write rules into `DOCKER-USER` directly:

```bash
sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 5432 -j DROP
```

Prefer not publishing the port in the first place.

## Verifying from outside

The check that matters cannot be run on the host itself. From another machine,
outside your tailnet:

```bash
nc -zv vps.example.com 80
nc -zv vps.example.com 443
nc -zv vps.example.com 5432     # must fail, in every profile
```

In the private profile, all three should fail.

## Cloud provider firewalls

A security group or cloud firewall usually sits in front of the host and is
evaluated before anything on it. Both have to allow a port for it to be
reachable, and the cloud layer is a good place to keep 80/443 closed while you
are on the private profile.
